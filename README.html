<p>scss/config/_settings.scss: Original Foundation 5 base settings
scss/config/_custom-settings.scss: Copy the settings you will modify to this file. Make it your own
scss/site/*.scss: Unleash your creativity and make it look perfect. Create the files you need (and remember to make import statements for all your files in scss/foundation.scss)</p>

<p>css/foundation.css: All Sass files are minified and compiled to this file</p>

<p>css/foundation.css.map: CSS source maps</p>

<h3 id="scriptfolderstrucutre">Script Folder Strucutre</h3>

<p>bower_components/: This is the source folder where all Foundation components are located. foundation update will check and update scripts in this folder.</p>

<p>js/vendor: Vendor scripts are copied from bower_components/ to this directory. We use this path for enqueing the vendor scripts in WordPress.</p>

<p>Please note that you must run grunt build in your terminal for the script to be copied and concatinated. See Gruntfile.js for details</p>
